# CommaAI Speed Challenge
Sample code for commaAI speed challenge (dense mapping still work in progress).</br>
Task: predicting speed of a car from dashcam footage.</br>
Approach: using dense flow and feature matching to track feature across consecutive frames in order to create a mapping system. Avoids dynamic features (e.g. other  cars) by implementing a pre-trained CNN. </br>

### Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment when running this script. Run the following commands in the root directory of the project.
```
python3 -m venv <env-folder-name>
```

To activate that virtual environment, use the below command:
```
source <env-folder-name>/bin/activate
```

After activating, to install the dependencies run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code
For sparse flow, run:
```
python odometry.py
```

For dense flow (incomplete), run:
```
python dense.py
```
